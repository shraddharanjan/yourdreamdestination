                Hi,my name is Manjit Somal and I'm 19. Here is a little introduction to me. I'm currently in University
                studying Computer Science. I've been interested in technology for as long as I can remember and I'm
                always looking to broaden my knowledge about certain topics within technology. I love playing piano and
                I've been playing for about 10 years now. My dream destination is Switzerland and I hope you have
                enjoyed learning a bit about Switzerland. I was in charge of the Cascading Style Sheets for this
                website, otherwise known as CSS. I was initially not looking forward to the styling because it's
                definitely not my strong spot but I've learned a lot and I've grown to really enjoy doing it. I hope you
                all enjoy this website and find it informative!
            </p>

                Hi, I'm Ella and I am 25 years old I'm a knitwear and crochet designer and I spent 3 months in Japan as
                part of an exchange program. I was based in Kyoto, Japan and this is where I reignited my love for
                tradition and craft. I love dance and movement and my work is about this. I am working to get into the
                digital side of fashion and creative design starting with different coding languages for web
                development.

                Hi, my name is Qi Wu. I've just graduated in film and I'm working as a videographer in London. I'm
                interested in Computer Science and hope to find an interesting interface between it and the arts and
                explore various career paths. Finland is my dream destination because it's the home of my favourite
                director Aki KaurismÃ¤ki and where his stories are set. I was in charge of the editing of the video and
                the HTML for the different destinations. I hope you enjoy the website and get some of the information
                you want.

                Hello, my name is Shraddha Ranjan and I am a final year medical student. I really love both Computer
                Science and Medicine so I would love to use my knowledge about medicine to enhance healthcare provided
                to patients and I believe technology will enable this! I would love to go to Australia one day- I love
                nice weather and I think a few weeks of sunshine will help with the post Christmas blues ðŸ˜Š I was in
                charge of the bootstrap/ javascript for this website and itâ€™s been a really useful experience!
